I'm a last year Ph.D. student of Machine Learning Joint Public Policy in [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Leman Akoglu](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/). My research mainly focuses on developing machine learning algorithms over graph-structured data, and applying designed algorithm to solve real-world problems. In the meantime, I have worked on pretraining LLMs, diffusion based generative models. In future, I’m interested in combining graph models and LLMs to boost LLMs’ reasoning and emergent abilities in different stages, and towards a multimodal generative foundation model. 

I finished my Master's in [ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department at Carnegie Mellon Univrsity, and Bachelor's (while I was in power system area) in EE department at Xi'an Jiaotong University. 

I have a twin brother [Lingfei Zhao](https://phy.duke.edu/people/lingfei-zhao) pursuing his Ph.D. of Physics at Duke University. We enjoy games together :).
