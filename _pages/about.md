I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student of information system and machine learning in [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Leman Akoglu](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/). My research mainly focuses on devevolping machine learning algorithms over graph-structured data, and applying designed algorithm to solve real-world problems.

I finished my Master in [ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department at Carnegie Mellon Univrsity, and Bachelor (while I was in power system area) in EE department at Xi'an Jiaotong University. 

I have a twin brother [Lingfei Zhao](https://phy.duke.edu/people/lingfei-zhao) pursuing his Ph.D. of Physics at Duke University. We enjoy games togethor :).
