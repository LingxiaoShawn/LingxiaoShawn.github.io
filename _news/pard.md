[Improving and Unifying Discrete- and Continuous-time Discrete Denoising Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03701) and [Pard: Permutation-Invariant Autoregressive Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03687) are now available at arxiv! 

If you work on discrete/categorical data's generative model, don't miss our paper that unifies and improves discrete denoising diffusion. 

Also, Pard is a the first permutation-invariant graph generative model that combines the strength of diffusion models and autoregressive methods. Pard achieves greatly improved performance on many benchmarks!
